# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
### Showcase technical ability to establish filter UFO sightings for multiple criteria at the same time.
## Results
### Initially, the webpage database only included a date filter. With the update visitors can now search for information by city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
### As opposed to a search bar, I would encourage Dana to install a drop down menu. In its current state, visitors need to know what they are looking for to find it. Without the drop down, visitors lose discoverability and may miss cool UFO sitings informaiton.
